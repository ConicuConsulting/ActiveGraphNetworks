# Deployment Strategy for AGNs

## 1. Deployment Models
- **Cloud Deployment**: Using Azure App Services for scalability.
- **Hybrid Deployment**: Combining on-premises infrastructure with cloud capabilities for flexibility.
- **On-Premises Deployment**: For secure, isolated environments (defense, healthcare).

## 2. Environment Setup
### 2.1. Development
- Docker containers for isolated testing environments.
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines.

### 2.2. Staging
- Cloud-based setup mirroring the production environment.
- Includes database sync and data encryption mechanisms.

## 3. Deployment Steps
1. **Build and Test**: Run automated tests using Jenkins and Mocha.
2. **Deploy on Cloud**: Use Azure DevOps for deployment on Azure/AWS.
3. **Monitor and Optimize**: Implement monitoring with Azure Monitor.

## 4. Rollback Plan
- Snapshots and backups for all deployments.
- Version control through GitHub for tracking changes.

**[User input required]**: Add specific rollback procedures for custom modules.
