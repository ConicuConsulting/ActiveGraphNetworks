# Active Graph Networks (AGNs) - Testing Plan

**Objective:** The objective of this testing plan is to ensure the stability, performance, and functionality of the AGN framework, covering all aspects from the core graph database, UI, and APIs, to data security and integration with external systems.

## 1. Testing Scope

The testing scope covers:

- Core graph database operations (CRUD operations for nodes and edges, queries)
- UI functionality and interaction with the graph
- API endpoints for accessing and managing graph data
- Data security (encryption, access control, and data integrity)
- Integration with external systems (e.g., HL7 and FHIR for healthcare, financial APIs for trading bots)
- Scalability and performance tests for large datasets and concurrent users

## 2. Testing Phases

1. **Unit Testing:**
   - Focuses on individual components (functions, classes, or modules) within the AGN framework.
   - Ensures that each component operates as expected and handles edge cases.
2. **Integration Testing:**
   - Tests the interaction between different modules and components of AGNs, such as the graph database communicating with the UI or APIs handling queries from external systems.
   - Ensures that modules work together correctly and that data flows smoothly between them.
3. **System Testing:**
   - Tests the complete AGN system, ensuring that all integrated components function as a whole.
   - Includes performance, load, and stress testing to validate how the system behaves under various conditions.
4. **Security Testing:**
   - Ensures data encryption in transit and at rest is working as expected.
   - Validates access controls, permissions, and security policies to prevent unauthorized access.
5. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**
   - Conducted with domain experts or end users to validate that AGNs meet the requirements and expectations.
   - Tests real-world use cases like querying patient data (in healthcare) or executing trades (in finance).

### C. System Testing

| Test Case ID | Scenario       | Test Description                      | Expected Result                       | Status   |
|--------------|----------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------|
| ST-01        | Large Dataset  | Load graph with 1M nodes and test query speed. | Queries execute within acceptable limits. | Pass/Fail|
| ST-02        | Concurrent Users | Simulate 1000 concurrent users accessing APIs. | System remains stable, with no downtime. | Pass/Fail|
| ST-03        | Data Sync      | Test the sync mechanism between on-premises and cloud environments. | Data is consistent across environments. | Pass/Fail|

### D. Security Testing

| Test Case ID | Security Aspect | Test Description                     | Expected Result                       | Status   |
|--------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------|
| SEC-01       | Data Encryption | Validate data is encrypted at rest and in transit. | Data is secure and cannot be read in transit. | Pass/Fail|
| SEC-02       | Access Control  | Test access based on user roles and permissions. | Only authorized users can access resources. | Pass/Fail|

### E. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

| Test Case ID | Use Case       | Test Description                     | Expected Result                       | Status   |
|--------------|----------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------|
| UAT-01       | Healthcare Query | Query patient records using HL7 standards. | Patient data is retrieved accurately. | Pass/Fail|
| UAT-02       | Trading Execution | Test the trading botâ€™s decision-making using AGNs. | Trades execute based on predefined policies. | Pass/Fail|

## 4. Performance Testing Metrics

- **Latency:** Measure the time taken for query execution and node/edge creation.
- **Throughput:** Measure the number of transactions per second (TPS) during peak load.
- **Scalability:** Assess system performance with increasing numbers of nodes, edges, and users.

## 5. Tools and Technologies

- **Unit Testing:** PyTest (Python), Mocha (JavaScript)
- **Integration Testing:** Postman for API testing, Selenium for UI testing
- **Load Testing:** JMeter for stress and load testing
- **Security Testing:** OWASP ZAP for penetration testing
- **CI/CD Integration:** Jenkins, GitHub Actions for automated testing pipelines

## 6. Test Execution Schedule

## 7. Defect Management

- Defects will be logged in JIRA, categorized by severity (Critical, Major, Minor), and assigned to relevant developers.
- Defects will be tracked until resolved and validated through regression testing.

## 8. Test Environment

- **Development:** Local developer machines using Docker containers for isolated testing.
- **Staging:** Cloud-based test environment mirroring the production setup, including on-premises sync mechanisms.
- **Production:** Final validation occurs post-deployment in a controlled production-like environment.

## 9. Regression Testing

- Regression tests will be performed after every major update or bug fix to ensure that new changes do not affect existing functionality.
- Automated tests using CI/CD will trigger regression tests for continuous validation.

This testing plan ensures that AGNs are rigorously tested across all levels, focusing on functionality, security, scalability, and real-world applicability.
