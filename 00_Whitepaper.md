Got it! Let's make sure it works well with GitHub's Mermaid syntax by simplifying any special characters in the labels.

### Diagram: Multi-Domain Feed Data

```mermaid
graph TD;
    Healthcare[Healthcare Domain] -->|Feeds Data| AGDB[Active Graph Database];
    Finance[Finance Domain] -->|Feeds Data| AGDB;
    Legal[Legal Domain] -->|Feeds Data| AGDB;
    AGDB --> AGN_Model[AGN Model Contextual Relationships Across Domains];
```

I've removed the curly braces around "Contextual Relationships Across Domains" in the AGN Model label. This should now be compatible with GitHub's Mermaid renderer. Let me know if there's anything else you'd like to adjust!
