The issue seems to be with the curly braces `{}` in the node label for `AGN_Model`. Mermaid does not support these characters directly. Letâ€™s update the diagram to resolve this:

```mermaid
graph TD
    Healthcare["Healthcare Domain"] -->|Feeds Data| AGDB["Active Graph Database"]
    Finance["Finance Domain"] -->|Feeds Data| AGDB
    Legal["Legal Domain"] -->|Feeds Data| AGDB
    AGDB --> AGN_Model["AGN Model (Contextual Relationships Across Domains)"]
```

**Fixes applied:**
1. Removed the semicolon after `graph TD;` as it is not needed.
2. Wrapped all node labels in `"` to avoid issues with special characters.
3. Replaced curly braces `{}` with parentheses `()` in the label of `AGN_Model`.

This version should now render without errors. Let me know if you need further assistance!
