It looks like GitHub's Mermaid parser is having trouble with parentheses in node labels as well. Letâ€™s simplify the labels by avoiding both curly braces and parentheses. Here are the updated diagrams:

### Diagram 2: Policy-Driven AI

```mermaid
graph TD;
    Node_A[Node A Financial Data] -->|Policy Enforced Relationship| Node_B[Node B Economic Indicator];
    Node_B -->|Inheritance Allowed| Node_C[Node C Regional Context];
    Policy_Engine[Policy Engine] -->|Defines Rules| Node_A;
    Policy_Engine -->|Defines Rules| Node_B;
```

### Diagram 6: Multi-Domain Architecture

```mermaid
graph TD;
    Healthcare[Healthcare Domain] -->|Feeds Data| AGDB[Active Graph Database];
    Finance[Finance Domain] -->|Feeds Data| AGDB;
    Legal[Legal Domain] -->|Feeds Data| AGDB;
    AGDB --> AGN_Model[AGN Model Contextual Relationships Across Domains];
```

These changes should resolve the parsing issues, as the node labels are now simplified to text without any special characters. Let me know if you need further assistance!
