The error in your Mermaid diagram is caused by a mismatch between the Mermaid syntax and the use of curly braces `{}`. The correct syntax should use parentheses `()` instead of curly braces.

Here's the fixed version of your diagram:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    Node_A[Node A (Financial Data)] -->|Policy Enforced Relationship| Node_B[Node B (Economic Indicator)];
    Node_B -->|Inheritance Allowed| Node_C[Node C (Regional Context)];
    Policy_Engine[Policy Engine] -->|Defines Rules| Node_A;
    Policy_Engine -->|Defines Rules| Node_B;
```

I've replaced `{}` with `()` to make the node labels compatible with the Mermaid syntax used by GitHub. This should resolve the parsing error.
