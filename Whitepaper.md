## **Key Components and Structure**

### **Four Dimensions of Cube4D**

1. **X-Axis (What)**: Represents raw data nodes, individual data points, or knowledge bases.
2. **Y-Axis (Why)**: Captures relational connections, indicating the purpose behind data interactions.
3. **Z-Axis (How)**: Governs policies and adaptability mechanisms for real-time relational adjustments.
4. **Temporal Dimension (When)**: Adds a time-sensitive layer, enabling data structures to adapt based on chronological changes.
